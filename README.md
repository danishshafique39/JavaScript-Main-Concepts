âœ… Variables & Data Types (let, const, string, number, boolean, object, array)
âœ… Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, ternary)
âœ… Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)
âœ… Loops (for, while, do-while, for...of, for...in)
âœ… Functions (declaration, expression, arrow functions)
âœ… Arrays & Objects (manipulation, methods, iteration)
âœ… DOM Manipulation (selecting, modifying, adding, removing elements)
âœ… Events (handling user interactions)
